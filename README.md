# FocusFlow
A Pomodoro Timer website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I'm using vanilla JavaScript for this project.

I have attached a plan of my almost finished view of this project.

Version 1: Pomodoro Timer

- Simple HTML & CSS design 
- Simple JavaScript

The pomodoro timer goes through 4 Focus mode session which last 25 mins each, 
and a 5 min break between each session.
After the 4 sessions are over you get a long 45 mins break.
This continues until you stop the timer.

There will be a functionality that will allow you to edit the time frame to your suitable liking, but currently it is fixed in the code.
