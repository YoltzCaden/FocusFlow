** This will be updated as I go along the project and get ideas.


Version 1: Pomodoro Timer

- Simple HTML & CSS design 
- Simple JavaScript

The pomodoro timer goes through Focus Sessions which last 25 mins each, 
and a 5 min break between each session.
This continues until you stop the timer.

There will be a functionality that will allow you to edit the time frame to your suitable liking, but currently it is fixed in the code.
